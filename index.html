        <p class="lead mb-4">My Name is Celeste Padila and I go to University of California Riverside. I like being outdoors and I am also more extroverted than introverted. I like doing fun creative projects, for example  painting on canvas and whatever I can get my hands on. I like helping other people who canâ€™t help themselves. I care a lot about others and would go out of my way to help them in their needs. I love going and experiencing new things and places with my family and friends. I love traveling to different places and hopefully in the near future I will be able to travel all around the world. I would like to see the beautiful cultures, traditions and foods of each country I go to. I love being with my family and friends during the holidays and just being in the comfort of my own home makes me the happiest. There are many other things that I would like to experience in my future and I have set some goals to achieve and I hope to accomplish them soon.
<br><br>

        I have volunteered in many different things but especially in school areas. I helped in tutoring students who were struggling in math and in any other subjects they needed help on. I helped during the festivals by decorating and assembling the booths. I have also helped in registering middle school kids for the next school year. I like volunteering because I am doing it out of the kindness of my heart. I will put others before me and will make time to show that I care about them. I have sold many things throughout my life like products or promotional items. I have also volunteered in my local community. I helped prepare food for my church and have sold it to my community. I hope in the near future I am able to volunteer more of my time into my community and in others outside of school, state or nation. I would like to go into countries who donâ€™t have a lot of access to food, water or education. I want to help them with building a school, homes and access to water.

<br><br>

        During High school I was in culinary arts class and I had hands-on experience with cooking and serving food. I collaborated with other students in my class and got to serve and sell food outside of my classroom to other students, teachers and faculty. I was also a part of a couple of clubs. I was in one that helped make donations and fundraise to help people in need of the basic necessities. We fundraised in our school and served food to the community. We then helped package the items into bags to send them off to the families who were in need. We also donated clothes for whoever needed them. Throughout these whole experiences it helped me open my eyes to see that people are struggling and I need to help the most I can so they can be happy and healthy with their beautiful families and friends.
